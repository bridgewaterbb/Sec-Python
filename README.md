<h1 align="center">Python Security Tools</h1>
<p>This is a repo where I will place Python code I create while learning. I'm using books, such as Black Hat Python, and various other resources to learn.</p>
<p>The goal is to start with smaller tools and eventually work towards larger, more complex tools, such as a C2C solution.</p>
<p>For now, this repo will only contain code. Eventually, I will add projects demonstrating different code in use.</p>
